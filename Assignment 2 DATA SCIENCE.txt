Assignment 2 DATA SCIENCE 
How a Machine Learning Model for Traffic Accident Analysis Can Help Underdeveloped Countries. 
1️.Proactive Accident Prevention 
•	Predicts high-risk areas and accident-prone times. 
•	Enables authorities to issue early warnings to drivers. 
•	Helps enforce dynamic speed limits based on real-time conditions (e.g., reducing speed limits during heavy rain). 
2️. Optimizing Traffic Management & Infrastructure 
•	Identifies accident hotspots for better road planning. 
•	Supports smart traffic control systems that adjust speed limits dynamically. 
•	Helps prioritize road safety investments, such as street lighting in high-risk areas. 
3️. Efficient Emergency Response 
•	Predicts accident-prone locations to position ambulances strategically. 
•	Improves hospital preparedness by anticipating peak accident times. 
•	Enables better resource allocation for emergency services. 
4️. Improving Road Safety Education & Policies 
•	Provides data-driven insights for awareness campaigns (e.g., educating drivers on misty weather risks). 
•	Supports the introduction of stronger traffic laws based on accident patterns. 
•	Encourages safety regulations, such as mandatory helmet laws for motorcyclists in high-risk conditions. 5️. Affordable & Scalable Implementation 
•	Can utilize mobile phone data and GPS sensors for real-time tracking. 
•	Cloud-based AI solutions make it accessible without expensive infrastructure. 
•	Encourages collaboration between traffic authorities, hospitals, and data analysts to improve accuracy. 
6️ Saving Lives & Reducing Economic Losses 
•	Helps reduce traffic-related fatalities and injuries. 
•	Minimizes accident-related healthcare costs. 
•	Improves transportation efficiency, boosting economic productivity.
